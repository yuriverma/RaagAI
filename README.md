# 🎵 RaagAI — From Heartbreak to Harmony
"In the stillness of a sleepless night, when even silence has a sound, RaagAI was born — not from code, but from chaos, from tears that tasted like raag Bhairavi, from hope stitched together by harmonium loops and tabla drops. A musical rebellion against rejection. A love letter to dreams."
